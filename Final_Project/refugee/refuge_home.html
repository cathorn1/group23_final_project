		<h2>About us:</h2>
		<p>This project is inspired by the increasing number of refugees applying for refugee 
		resettlement to the United States. One of the members of our group, originally from Daraa, 
		Syria, received refugee designation by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
		(UNHCR) during the Syrian Civil War and was approved by the U.S. State Department to be 
		resettled in the United States.  In 2016, he was then resettled by one of the nine national 
		refugee resettlement agencies in the United States, HIAS, whose local affiliate, Carolina 
		Refugee Resettlement Agency, resettled him in Charlotte. His experience has motivated us 
		to create a product to assist future refugees, policymakers, resettlement agencies, and 
		researchers.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Product Vision:</h2>
		<p>FOR policymakers, resettlement agencies, researchers, and refugees who need access to data 
		regarding refugee resettlement in the United States, WHO would benefit from an information 
		dashboard representing the state of refugee resettlement in the U.S. THE Refugee Information 
		Hub is a dashboard website THAT explores the people and locations impacted by the relocation 
		of refugees in the U.S.. UNLIKE the UN dataset, OUR PRODUCT streamlines pertinent information 
		in one convenient location, is focused on the U.S., North Carolina and Charlotte, and is easy 
		to use by anyone, and will provide access to various sources.</p>
